if you are going to import large files with many records, i suggest to run queues, like so:

```php artisan queue:work```

## How to use it

#### Demo CSV files

By the way, if you have no time to make csv files to test, no worries, please, feel free to dowload some files already to use localed in demo_csv_files directory of this project, just click [here](demo_csv_files), even if you wish, download csv_files_sample.zip there.

You may find several samples:

- **Successful contact records**: sample_200_records.csv, sample_50_records.csv and sample_5_records.csv

- **Failed contact records**: sample_10_records_witherrors.csv, with this sample you may test how some incorrect records are skipped and recorded in errors log

#### You need to be autheticated

![login_zone.png](login_zone.png)

You may use next credentials to log in application:

    - User: koombea2@koombea.co
    - Pass: 12345678

However, i recommend to register your user:

## Code Contributors

#### Why invent the wheel?

I decided to use some third-party libraries to solve credit card validations and excel file manipulation and i think that they deserve the credit :)

- **PHP Credit Cards**: A PHP package to perform operations on debit and credit cards like format, validate brand, number and Luhn algorithm. It validates popular brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc. 

    This package is based on the braintree/credit-card-type javascript package. All the card types configuration have been extracted from it.

    You may find further information in here: https://github.com/jlorente/php-credit-cards

- **Laravel Excel**: üöÄ Laravel Excel is intended at being Laravel-flavoured PhpSpreadsheet: a simple, but elegant wrapper around PhpSpreadsheet with the goal of simplifying exports and imports.

    üî• **PhpSpreadsheet** is a library written in pure PHP and providing a set of classes that allow you to read from and to write to different spreadsheet file formats, like Excel and LibreOffice Calc.
